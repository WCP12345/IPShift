# IPShift quick and easy IP assigning to adaptors.

Hi, I've been working on a project that allows people to save IP configurations and apply them to network adaptors.

Im not sure if this solves a problem for the majority of people but it helps me and i thought it might help others as well! (yes there are other apps that do this)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Profiles - add profile for different IP and DNS configurations

Import / Export - the ability to backup and restore your profiles

Adaptors - selectable from a dropdown menu in the app

Reset to DHCP - easily reset your adaptors to DHCP

Tray Icon - Can select profile and apply to your adaptors from thr tray bar

Offline - profiles stored localy


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am new to programming with C# so the app might be a bit buggy (I tried my best to get it bug free!), I did have help from AI to create this app.

I am open to any suggestions / feedback! :)

Key: IPSHIFT-X6UF9-52HC0

Hope if come in handy!
